# A Slack bot for reserving the meeting rooms at Make School

## Proposal:
Staffs and students of Make School uses the great hall meeting rooms for multiple purposes. For students, one pain point that is expressed is the inability to reserve a room. Reservations give students the reassurances that they can be undisturbed when using the rooms for industry contacts, phone screens, video interviews, etc. I plan to write a Slack bot where staffs and students can enter a command in a Slack channel to "CRUD" their room reservations.
